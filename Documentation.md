# Documentation ARM Data Science Project
## First Meeting and Launch of the Project
### Meeting Tao Dou, our contact from ARM's Cambridge office on the 2nd of May.

We were given a presentation of the project including the data we would be given, ARM's workflow regarding the treatment of the data, and what was expected from us. We got to ask questions to clear up some unclear points and signed an NDA without which we could not get hold of the data.

## Second Meeting and Follow up questions
### Skype with Chris Hawkins, ARM's engineer on the 16th of May.

We were given the chance to ask Chris about the following questions relating to our project. 
1. Missing Perl Scripts needed for Yield/Vddmin data.
2. Preferences of the data dashboard (website, GUI, etc..).
3. Further data logs needed in order to generate BA data or Correlation script output.
4. Expectation of the scope of the project (data set, sections, etc..).

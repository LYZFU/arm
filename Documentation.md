# Documentation ARM Data Science Project
## First Meeting and Launch of the Project
### Meeting Tao Dou, our contact from ARM's Cambridge office on the 2nd of May.

We were given a presentation of the project including the data we would be given, ARM's workflow regarding the treatment of the data, and what was expected from us. We got to ask questions to clear up some unclear points and signed an NDA without which we could not get hold of the data.

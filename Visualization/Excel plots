SC Yield:
Data required: 
    • File name -> Temperature and Split
    • tb_sc_yd_vmin_shm -> Library name, voltage (vdd) value, test frequency, P/F
Expected output:
    • Title -> Voltage and Temperature (since libraries are common over different splits)
    • X-axis -> Different libraries
    • Y-axis -> Yield %
    • Of course, each split has its own line on the plot
    • There are 20 parts tested for each split -> One failure leads to a 5% decrement

SC Vmin:
Data required:
    • File name -> Temperature and Split
    • shmoo_bsmin_vec_stdcell -> Library name, vmin value
    • Operating spec
Expected output:
    • Title -> Library and Temperature
    • X-axis -> vdd (corresponding to vmin values)
    • Y-axis -> Probability of pass
    • One line per split on the graph

SC Shmoo data:
Data required:
    • Title -> Process and Temperature
    • shmoo_bsmin_vec_stdcell -> vmin for passing
Expected output:
    • Table with visual representation of threshold (i.e. smaller than vmin leads to failure, and hopefully larger than vmin implies passing)

Rest:
Missing data?

Memory: yield and vmin plot, same as for SC.

Intro -> Identify problem and client needs:
  - Problem -> inefficient process:
    -> individual perl scripts demand a lot of work to extract data
    -> convoluted process to obtain graphs, requires excel VBA
    -> difficult navigation through the files since all is done through perl and excel
    
The Solution -> Proposed Concept:

  - Data Preprocessing:


  - PyQT5:


  - Data Science:
    -> Uncover correlations between parameters in the data (e.g. using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA))
    -> Visually display relationships (e.g. using correlation matrices, group boxplots)

  - Selling Point:

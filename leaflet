Intro -> Identify problem and client needs:
  - Problem -> inefficient process:
    -> individual perl scripts demand a lot of work to extract data
    -> convoluted process to obtain graphs, requires excel VBA
    -> difficult navigation through the files since all is done through perl and excel
    
Arm is the worldâ€™s leading semiconductor IP company, with 125 billion chips shipped to date and these devices are used by over 70% of the global population. 

Today, several large-scale data analysis systems exist for product test data, but extracting the useful information from these data in a timely manner saves both engineering effort and reduces human errors which may affect the customer. Currently, engineers need to manually analyse these files and create reports for Arm and customers. Using individual perl scripts demand a lot of work to extract data and navigation through the files is extremely difficult since the work is done through perl and excel. This process is laborious and leads to a high degree of error in the existing scheme of data extraction.

Therefore, we propose an automated solution which will yield substantial acceleration and reduce testing efforts and costs. The goal is to validate Arm IP using a combination of Test data and target silicon data received from the foundry to confirm the chip was manufactured within a reasonable range of the expected process target window.
    
The Solution -> Proposed Concept:

  - Data Preprocessing:


  - PyQT5:


  - Data Science:
    -> Uncover correlations between parameters in the data (e.g. using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA))
    -> Visually display relationships (e.g. using correlation matrices, group boxplots)

  - Selling Point:

# ARM Data Visualization and Data Science
This repository contains an improved and automated approach to improve ARM's chip data work flow.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository into your local directory to get the source code.

### Prerequisites

You will need [Python 3](https://www.python.org) installed, a data folder provided by ARM that contains all the raw ASCII data txt files.

### Installing

Install the necessary packages:
```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install pyqt5
pip install dython
pip install joblib
```



## Deployment

Move the data folder in to the gui folder with the same directory as main.cpp
From the root folder, access the gui folder and run the GUI application:
```
cd Visualization/gui
python3 main.py
```
